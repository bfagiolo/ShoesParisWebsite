Paris Shoes is a modern, full-stack e-commerce web application built with Angular 19 and integrated with Firebase Realtime Database, Authentication, and Hosting. Designed with a sleek user interface and mobile responsiveness, the app allows users to browse products, filter with live search, manage a persistent cart, and complete a detailed checkout process. Admins can securely log in, view customer orders in real-time, and dynamically add new products via a custom form, including support for product images and color variants.

Core features include:

🔎 Live search filtering with reactive state handling

🛒 Cart persistence across sessions (even without login)

✅ Full checkout validation, address autofill, and credit card formatting

🔐 Admin-only authentication with persistent session handling

📦 Realtime order tracking in the Firebase database with auto-generated Order IDs

✨ Custom product rating component (interactive and syncs to database)

⚙️ Admin product uploader with image handling and custom dropdowns

🚀 Deployed with Firebase Hosting, accessible via a public link

This project demonstrates front-end engineering, full CRUD operations with Firebase, reactive form design, and scalable architecture — built from scratch with real-world deployment in mind.
